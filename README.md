# Lesson 6 Project
This project will assess your knowledge and skills of the web development life cycle. In this lesson, you will continue from the project plan you developed in Lesson 5 to build, test, and publish the web site using GitHub pages.

## Project Scenario
Refer to the lesson 5 project directions for the scenario.

## Project Prep
1. If necessary, clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there.
   > *TIP: Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.*
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions. *You can ignore the `.gitignore` file.*

## Project Directions
Refer to the project documentation that you created for Lesson 5 and review any feedback from your instructor to see if any adjustments need to be made as you begin working on creating the website.

> Be sure you are saving your files and applying commits after completing major steps in the project.

1. Create or add any assets that are needed for the project and save them to the repo within appropriate folders.
2. Create the HTML pages defined in the project documentation.
   1. Add the necessary metadata, sections, and other elements to provide the overall structure of the pages.
   2. Add the navigation links, headings, and the other content to the page, using appropriate elements.
3. Create the CSS file and link to it within the HTML pages.
   1. Add the color scheme using variables.
   2. Import and add the font information.
   3. Create the necessary selectors and define the properties to layout the page and content on the page.

## Project Test Directions
Once all the files are created and the coding as finished:

1. Test your site locally to make sure that:
   1. The links work
   2. Images load
   3. The UX works as expected
   4. The UI matches the design documentation

## Project Publish Directions
After testing the site:

1. Publish the site using GitHub Pages.
2. Re-test the site to ensure that everything is still working and fix any errors that you find.

## Submit the Project
Before you submit your project:

1. Make sure that you have validated your HTML and CSS code. If any errors were found within the validators, be sure to fix those errors before you submit your assignment.
2. Be sure you have implement accessibility best practices.
3. Apply any final commits to your work.
4. Push (i.e., sync) the repo on your computer with GitHub to ensure all files are uploaded for your instructor to see.
5. Verify that all files appear on GitHub.
6. Open the Pull Requests tab within GitHub (or using the GitHub Extension within VS Code).
7. In the comment field,
   1. Type in your instructor's username with an @ before. See the course announcements for their username to use.
   2. Tell your instructor that your Project is ready for grading.
8. Click on the `Comment` button to finalize and submit your assignment.
